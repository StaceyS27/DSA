// Hash Tables

// hash table (also known as hash map) is a data structure used to store key-value pairs
// when you have a key, can allow for easy lookup of a value
// JS object also stores key value pairs
    // it is a special implementation of hash table 
    // object class has its own keys so keys that you add may conflict with those present
// maps were introduced 2015 to resolve that issue | has no inherit keys 

// stores key value pairs in a fix sized array
// hash tables undergo hashing function to convert string key to numerical index
// value is then stored

// supports 3 main operations:
    // 1. set | store key-value pair
    // 2. get | retrieve a value given its key
    // 3. remove | delete key value pair 

// hash tables are implemented where constant time lookup and insertion are required
    // database indexing - used to increase speed of retrieval of data from database by creating indices at specific columns 
    // caches
