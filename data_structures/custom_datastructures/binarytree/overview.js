// a binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children
    // referred to as the left and right child 

// a binary search tree 
    // the value of each left node must be smaller than the parent noded
    // the value of each right node must be greater than the parent node
    // like a binary search tree, each node at most has two children 

// binary search tree operations: 
    // 1. insertion: add a node to the tree
    // 2. search: find a node given its value 
    // 3. DFS & BFS: to visit all nodes in the tree
    // 4. deletion: remove a node given its value 

// binary search tree usage:
    // 1. searching 
    // 2. sorting 
    // 3. to implement data types such as lookup tables and priority queues
        // lookup tables allow for efficient data retrievel based on key 
            // each key associated with a value 
        // priority queues allow elements to be inserted based on priority 
            // allows for retrieval and removal based on highest or lowest priority
